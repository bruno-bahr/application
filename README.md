# Employee Management Application

 - This application created using Python and Django aims at
managing data related to personnel.
- I designed the CSS on my own as part of the project.
- Everything revolves around a main screen from where the user
is able to choose the desired action and perform it in separate screens
with proper validation.
- The first step is to log into the system.

- If the username or password is incorrect, a message will be displayed.
